##Modification log:

1. first completed on, basic homepage for "landing cookie recipes"
2. updating the form function with adding submit information in js 
3. set express, babel , webpack env, ready to convert it to server side rendering react. Yet, I met an issue about image loading into React component and .css link to index.html. They are not working...
